# Cedar Python
![CI (main)](https://github.com/k9securityio/cedar-py/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
&nbsp;[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cedarpy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cedarpy)

`cedarpy` helps you use the (Rust) [Cedar Policy](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar/tree/main) library from Python. You can use `cedarpy` to:
* check whether a request is authorized by the [Cedar Policy](https://www.cedarpolicy.com) engine
* format policies

`cedarpy` packages are availble for the following platforms:
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Operating System</th><th>Processor Architectures</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>Linux</td><td>x86_64, aarch64</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mac</td><td>x86_64, aarch64</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Windows</td><td>x86_64</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note: This project is _not_ officially supported by AWS or the Cedar Policy team.

## Using the library
Releases of [`cedarpy`](https://pypi.org/project/cedarpy/) are available on PyPi.  You can install the latest release with:
```shell
pip install cedarpy
```

(See the Developing section for how to use artifacts you've built locally.)

### Authorizing access with Cedar policies in Python
Now you can use the library to authorize access with Cedar from your Python project using the `is_authorized` function.  Here's an example of basic use:

```python
from cedarpy import is_authorized, AuthzResult, Decision

policies: str = "//a string containing cedar policies"
entities: list = [  # a list of Cedar entities; can also be a json-formatted string of Cedar entities
    {"uid": {"__entity": { "type" : "User", "id" : "alice" }}, "attrs": {}, "parents": []}
    # ...
]
request = {
    "principal": "User::\"bob\"",
    "action": "Action::\"view\"",
    "resource": "Photo::\"1234-abcd\"",
    "context": {}
}

authz_result: AuthzResult = is_authorized(request, policies, entities)

# so you can assert on the decision like:
assert Decision.Allow == authz_result.decision

# or use the 'allowed' convenience method 
assert authz_result.allowed

# or even via AuthzResult's attribute subscripting support 
assert authz_result['allowed']

```
The [`AuthzResult`](cedarpy/__init__.py) class also provides diagnostics and metrics for the access evaluation request. 

See the [unit tests](tests/unit) for more examples of use and expected behavior.

### Authorize a batch of requests

You can also authorize a batch of requests with the `is_authorized_batch` function.  `is_authorized_batch` accepts a list of requests to evaluate against shared policies, entities, and schema.

Batch authorization is often _much_ more efficient (+10x) than processing authorization requests one by one with `is_authorized`.  This is because the most expensive part of the authorization process is transforming the policies, entities, and schema into objects that Cedar can evaluate.  See [RFC: support batch authorization requests](https://github.com/k9securityio/cedar-py/issues/13) for details.

Here's an example of how to use `is_authorized_batch` and the optional request-result `correlation_id`:

```python3
batch_id:str = randomstr()
requests: List[dict] = []
for action_name in action_names:
    requests.append({
        "principal": f'User::"{user_id}"',
        "action": f'Action::"{action_name}"',
        "resource": f'Resource::"{resource_id}"',
        "context": context_keys,
        "correlation_id": f"authz_req::{batch_id}-{action_name}"
    })

# ... resolve get policies, entities, schema ...

# process authorizations in batch
authz_results: List[AuthzResult] = is_authorized_batch(requests=requests, policies=policies, entities=entities, schema=schema)

# ... verify results came back in correct order via correlation_id ...
for request, result, in zip(requests, authz_results):
    assert request.get('correlation_id') == result.correlation_id

```
cedar-py returns the list of `AuthzResult` objects in the same order as the list of requests provided in the batch.

The above example also supplies an optional `correlation_id` in the request so that you can verify results are returned in the correct order or otherwise map a request to a result.



### Formatting Cedar policies

You can use `format_policies` to pretty-print Cedar policies according to
convention.

```python
from cedarpy import format_policies

policies: str = """
    permit(
        principal,
        action == Action::"edit",
        resource
    )
    when {
        resource.owner == principal
    };
"""

print(format_policies(policies))
# permit (
#   principal,
#   action == Action::"edit",
#   resource
# )
# when { resource.owner == principal };
```

## Developing


You'll need a few things to get started:

* Python +3.9
* Rust and `cargo`

This project is built on the [PyO3](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/index.html) and [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/index.html) projects.  These projects are designed to enable Python to use Rust code and vice versa.

The most common development commands are in the `Makefile`

### Create virtual env

First create a Python virtual environment for this project with:
`make venv-dev`

In addition to creating a dedicated virtual environment, this will install `cedar-py`'s dependencies.

If this works you should be able to run the following command:
``` shell
maturin --help
```

## Build and run `cedar-py` tests

Ensure the `cedar-py` virtual environment is active by sourcing it in your shell:

```shell
source venv-dev/bin/activate
```

Now run:
```shell
make quick
```

The `make quick` command will build the Rust source code with `maturin` and run the project's tests with `pytest`.

If all goes well, you should see output like:
```shell
(venv-dev) swedish-chef:cedar-py skuenzli$ make quick
Performing quick build
set -e ;\
	maturin develop ;\
	pytest

### Integration tests
This project supports validating correctness with official Cedar integration tests. To run those tests you'll need to retrieve the `cedar-integration-tests` data with:

```shell
make submodules
```

Then you can run:
```shell
make integration-tests
```

`cedar-py` currently passes 69 of the 82 tests defined in the `example_use_cases_doc`, `multi`, `ip`, and `decimal` suites. (The pass rate is actually higher, but we skip some tests that pass due to the way test suites are loaded.)  See [test_cedar_integration_tests.py](tests/integration/test_cedar_integration_tests.py) for details.

### Using locally-built artifacts

If you used `make quick` above, then a development build of the `cedarpy` module will already be installed in the virtual environment. 

If you want to use your local `cedarpy` changes in another Python environment, you'll need to build a release with:

```shell
make release
```

The release process will build a wheel and output it into `target/wheels/`

Now you can install that file with pip, e.g.:
```shell
pip install --force-reinstall /path/to/cedar-py/target/wheels/ccedarpy-*.whl
```
